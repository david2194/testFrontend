## How to build

To install the requirements, run:

```
$ npm install
```

To build the app for production, run:

```
$ npm run build
```

This will generate a `build.js` file in the `public/js` directory.


To run the development build, run

```
$ npm run dev
```

This watches changes to `.jsx` files and automatically builds the app in dev mode. Alternatively, you can run

```
$ npm run web
```

to also have a dev server on port 8080.
